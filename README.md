## Usage

1. **Configure your agents**:
    - Define agent behavior, communication protocols, and task workflows in the `config/` directory.

2. **Run the system**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Monitor agent interactions**:
    - Logs and performance metrics will be available in the `logs/` directory.
